# Level 2 Domains (Undergraduate / Professional Fundamentals)

This folder is intended for **Level 2 probe texts**: more technical and concept-rich statements.

Goal:
- measure whether the model still preserves domain separation
- test deeper knowledge boundaries beyond foundational facts

Notes:
- use more precise terminology
- include cause-effect and system-level concepts
