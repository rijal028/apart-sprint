# Level 1 Domains (Foundational)

This folder contains **Level 1 probe texts**: basic, school-level domain knowledge.

Goal:
- confirm the model forms stable clusters for core domains
- provide a clean baseline for domain ownership (win-rate)

Expected behavior:
- high intra-domain cohesion
- win-rate should be relatively high across strong encoder models
